"""
SQLAlchemy ORM models, associated types and validators.

The models Book, Highlight, HighlightTag and ReadwiseBatch are nested and intended to
be used in unison.

Readwise primary keys are used as database primary keys throughout for consistency with
Readwise object relationships.

Readwise API responses assume and rely upon Pydantic validation.

Note on ORM validation
----------------------
Mapped classes may seem to validate things that they actually don't:

- Type hints e.g. ``Mapped[int]`` and character limits e.g. ``String(511)`` are not
  enforced at runtime by SQLAlchemy. The underlying database dialect may - or may not -
  enforce them. SQLite is particularly permissive and enforces neither datatype nor
  character limits.

- Missing fields are accepted and default to None. This only results in an error when
  committing to the database and only if the field is ``nullable=False``.

        Primary key. Unique identifier sourced from Readwise.
    title: str
        The title of the parent object. E.g. Book title, twitter thread first post,
        podcast episode title etc.
    is_ deleted :
        User deleted book. Currently deleted books are stored with non-deleted books:
        handle downstream. No automation alters *highlights* of deleted books - it's
        assumed a deleted book's highlights will be fetched as "updated", with the
        highlights own 'is_deleted' status changed.
    author: str
        The article, tweet or article author, YouTube video creator, podcaster etc.
    readable_title : str
        The title, capitalized and tidied up. Reliably present (2993 out of 2993 sample
        user records).
    source : str
        A single word name for source of the object e.g ``Kindle``, ``twitter``,
        ``api_article`` etc.
    cover_image_url : str
        Link to the cover image. Set automatically by Readwise when highlighting via
        most methods. Seems to use native links where logical (e.g. Amazon, Twitter).
    unique_url : str
        Varies by input method. For example, ``"source": "web_clipper"`` may give a
        link to the original source document (i.e. the same link as ``source_url``).
        ``"source": "reader"`` may give the Readwise Reader link.
    summary : str
        Document summaries can be added in Readwise Reader.
    category : str
        A pre-defined Readwise category. Allowed values: ``books``, ``articles``,
        ``tweets``, ``podcasts``.
    document_note : str
        Can be added in Readwise Reader via the Notebook side panel.
    readwise_url : str
        The Readwise URL link to the "book"/parent object.
    source_url : str
        Link to the URL of the original source, if applicable. E.g. the Twitter account
        of the author, the original article etc.
    asin : str
        Not documented but Amazon Standard Identification Number. Only for Kindle
        highlights.

        Foreign key linking the ``id`` of the associated ``ReadwiseBatch``.

        from highlight tags. (i.e. "arch_btw" could exist separately at a book and
        highlight level).
